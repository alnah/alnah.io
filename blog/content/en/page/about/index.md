I build backend systems and CLI tools in Go, documenting the journey as I learn.

## Learning Path

I first touched Python 2 many years ago, then stepped away from programming. In 2024, I came back through [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). In 2025, I completed [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)'s backend path and started building with Go.

Books that shaped my approach:

- [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/) by Jon Bodner
- [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) by Chris James
- [Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book) by Alexander Shvets
- [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php) by John Ousterhout

## Current Projects

[go-md2pdf](https://github.com/alnah/go-md2pdf): A CLI tool that converts Markdown to PDF. Built with a concurrent worker pool, comprehensive test coverage, and 8 customizable CSS themes.

I'm also working on a personal EdTech project.

## Background

Trilingual in French, English, and Portuguese. I taught French for years: breaking down complex rules into clear steps, understanding why a learner gets stuck, adapting methods to how they think.

Today I build systems and tools in Go with the same approach: structuring code to be readable, diagnosing what's broken, delivering clean solutions rather than prototypes that just work, designing for real-world constraints, hunting down anti-patterns.

## What I Write About

This blog covers Go development from a practical angle:

- Concurrency patterns that work in production
- Testing strategies beyond the basics
- CLI tool design and distribution
- Lessons from building real projects

No fluff, no hype. Just what I learn while building.

## Get in Touch

Freelancer, open to remote backend projects.
